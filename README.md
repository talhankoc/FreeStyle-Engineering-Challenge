# FreeStyle Engineering Challenge

You are planning a party for an arbitrary number of people and you need to buy drinks and food. Assume youâ€™re given a budget (integer) and 3 files: 'people.txt', 'drinks.txt', 'food.txt'.

'people.txt' contains an arbitrary number of people with their preferred drinks and food; each entry will be 3 lines long (1st line: name (not unique), 2nd line: drinks (comma delimited, not sorted), 3rd line: food (comma delimited, not sorted). 

'drinks.txt' and 'food.txt' are arbitrarily large and each entry will be 1 line long in the following format: <drink or food name>:unit cost

Design and implement an algorithm that reads in the files and selects what drinks and foods you should purchase within your budget based on the information in the files. Be creative in how you optimize for food and drinks based on the known preferences.

Your answer should include an explanation of your algorithm, test cases, and a statement of all the assumptions you've made.
